/**
 * <p>A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Systems
 *    Manager offers two types of resource data sync: <code>SyncToDestination</code> and
 *     <code>SyncFromSource</code>.</p>
 *          <p>You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the <code>SyncToDestination</code> type to
 *    synchronize Inventory data from multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. For more information,
 *    see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html">Configuring Resource Data
 *     Sync for Inventory</a> in the <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the <code>SyncFromSource</code> type to synchronize
 *    operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple AWS Regions to a
 *    single S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple AWS accounts and
 *    Regions or <code>EntireOrganization</code> by using AWS Organizations. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html">Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions</a> in the
 *     <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a
 *    successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of
 *    a sync, use the <a>ListResourceDataSync</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption
 *     in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3
 *     bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy. </p>
 *          </note>
