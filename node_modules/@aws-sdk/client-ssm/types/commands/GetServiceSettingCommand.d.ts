/**
 * <p>
 *             <code>ServiceSetting</code> is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting
 *    defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an
 *    AWS service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS service
 *    team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless
 *    they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature.</p>
 *          <p>Services map a <code>SettingId</code> object to a setting value. AWS services teams define
 *    the default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new <code>SettingId</code>,
 *    but you can overwrite the default value if you have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code>
 *    permission for the setting. Use the <a>UpdateServiceSetting</a> API action to change
 *    the default setting. Or use the <a>ResetServiceSetting</a> to change the value back to
 *    the original value defined by the AWS service team.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Query the current service setting for the account. </p>
