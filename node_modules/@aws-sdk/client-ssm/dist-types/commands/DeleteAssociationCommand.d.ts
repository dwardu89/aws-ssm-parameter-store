 *          <p>When you disassociate a document from an instance, it doesn't change the configuration of
 *    the instance. To change the configuration state of an instance after you disassociate a document,

 *    instance.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SSMClient, DeleteAssociationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ssm"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SSMClient, DeleteAssociationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ssm"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SSMClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteAssociationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```

 * @see {@link DeleteAssociationCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SSMClientResolvedConfig | config} for SSMClient's `config` shape.
