/**
 * <p>Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises
 *    servers, edge devices, or virtual machine (VM) with Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Registering these machines with
 *    Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and
 *    ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about
 *    requirements for managing on-premises machines using Systems Manager, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html">Setting up
 *     Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for hybrid environments</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>. </p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, and on-premises servers and VMs that are
 *     configured for Systems Manager are all called <i>managed nodes</i>.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SSMClient, CreateActivationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ssm"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SSMClient, CreateActivationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ssm"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SSMClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateActivationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateActivationCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateActivationCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SSMClientResolvedConfig | config} for SSMClient's `config` shape.
